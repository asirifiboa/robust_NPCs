# Fast Adversarially Robust Nearest Prototype Classifiers
code for the master thesis topic "Comparison of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization learning dynamic and numerical stability regarding the Crammer-normalization and the Hein-normalization for adversarial robustness" based on the original implementation from

## Abstract
Adversarial robustness of a nearest prototype classifier assures safe deployment in sensitive use fields. Much research has been conducted on artificial neural networks regarding their robustness against adversarial attacks, whereas nearest prototype classifiers have not chalked similar successes. This thesis presents the learning dynamics and numerical stability regarding the Crammer normalization and the Heine normalization for adversarial robustness of nearest prototype classifiers. Results of conducted experiments are penned down and analyzed to ascertain the bounds given by Saralejew et al. and Hein et al. for adversarial robustness of nearest prototype classifiers.
